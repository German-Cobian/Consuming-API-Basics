# Consuming-API-Basics

A how-to on consuming API in Javascript. Specifically the API consumed is `/users` from [JSOPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The project is based on the tutorial video [Como consumir una API en JavaScript](https://youtu.be/a2cQ7YLyjzE) by "Codificandolo."
This application makes API calls to the "/users" resource in the {JSON}Placeholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) retrieving information about the users. It is meant to serve as a resource for practice in making API calls as the number of calls for specific information items about the user can be expanded in the "specific.js" file.

## Built With

* HTML
* Javascript
* {JSON}Placeholder API
* Linters ((stylelint, eslint))
